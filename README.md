# Zap Spark Initiative: Home Assistant Integration - Community Improvements

## Challenge Overview

We've created a reference implementation for the Zap P1-Meter Home Assistant integration, but we need the community's help to bring it to Home Assistant core standards. We're calling on talented developers to improve our open-source integration with UI configuration, multi-device support, comprehensive testing, and more. Help us create a professional integration that will be included in Home Assistant core!

## Grant Amounts

Multiple grants are available for specific improvements:
- **Config Flow Implementation (UI setup)**: 300 USDC
- **Multi-Device Support**: 200 USDC
- **Test Coverage (80%+)**: 200 USDC
- **DataUpdateCoordinator Migration**: 200 USDC
- **Additional improvements**: 100 USDC each

*First come, first served - claim an issue on GitHub to get started!*
